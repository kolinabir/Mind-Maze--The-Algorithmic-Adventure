## Development

This project is structured to implement different algorithms as engaging puzzle experiences. Each level showcases a different algorithm with interactive visualizations to help players understand how they work.

### Current Implementation Status:

- [x] Part 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure
- [x] Part 2: Home Screen and UI Design
- [x] Part 3: Maze Generation and Navigation (BFS/DFS)
- [x] Part 4: Water Jug Puzzle
- [ ] Part 5: Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax
- [ ] Part 6: Alpha-Beta Pruning
- [ ] Part 7: Final Integration Challenge
- [ ] Part 8: Graphics, Audio, and Polish
- [ ] Part 9: Save System and Tutorial

## Part 6: Strategy Game with Alpha-Beta Pruning

The Strategy Game level features:

1. **Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm**: An optimized search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the minimax search tree
2. **Pruning Visualization**: Interactive visualization showing how alpha-beta pruning eliminates unnecessary branches
3. **Strategy Board Game**: A challenging game where pieces move across the board toward the opponent's side
4. **Power-Up System**: Special items that give players advantages like extra moves or protected pieces
5. **Move Timer**: Time pressure element that requires quick decision making
6. **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Four difficulty settings that adjust AI search depth and time limits

### How to Play

- Select your pieces with a mouse click
- Yellow highlights show valid moves
- Capture opponent pieces by moving diagonally onto them
- Collect power-ups for special abilities
- Win by reaching the opponent's side or eliminating all opponent pieces
- Be careful not to run out of time!

### Understanding Alpha-Beta Pruning

The visualization panel shows:

- Alpha (red) and beta (blue) values that represent the best scores for each player
- When alpha becomes greater than or equal to beta, branches are pruned
- Pruned branches appear in red during the animation
- Statistics show how effective the pruning is at reducing the search space

## Part 7: Final Integration Challenge

The Final Integration Challenge combines all the algorithms you've learned into a comprehensive series of puzzles:

- **Algorithm Switching**: Analyze each challenge and choose the right algorithm
- **Mixed Challenges**: Tackle a variety of puzzle types requiring different algorithms
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Face increasingly complex challenges
- **Score System**: Earn points based on speed and algorithm selection
- **Algorithm Visualizations**: See how different algorithms work together

This culminating level tests your understanding of all the algorithms covered in the game, requiring you to apply the right technique to each situation.
